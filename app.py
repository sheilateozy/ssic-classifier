    st.write("""
        In Singapore, all firms are required to register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) during firm creation. During this registration, firms self-declare their Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code, which is the national standard for classifying economic activities, based on their planned business activities to be undertaken. 

        However, 2 scenarios are common:
        - Firms may not select the most appropriate SSIC code at the point of registration.
        - Firms may subsequently change their business activities and may not inform ACRA about this change.
        As a result, many firms' SSIC codes do not correctly reflect their business activities.

        This is a problem because the government relies on accurate firm SSIC codes for various monitoring and development purposes.
        
        Previously, officers manually read through each firm's business activity descriptions that are periodically collected over time through surveys, to determine if each firm's SSIC code is still reflective of its current business activities. If not, officers manually re-assign a new SSIC code to the firm.

        However, this requires:
        - A significant amount of man hours for reading thousands of texts.
        - Officers to have a good understanding of all SSIC codes, in order to correctly re-assign correct SSIC codes to firms. This is difficult as there are thousands of different SSIC codes in existence.

        To resolve the above problems, this project builds a text classifier to automatically classify firms into correct SSIC codes based on free-text descriptions of their business activities.
